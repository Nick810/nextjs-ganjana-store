Itâ€™s worth a drive out of the city to check out. And itâ€™s the perfect dispensary to stock up at for your vacation in Thailand. You wonâ€™t find a better selection of weed anywhere else in the country, especially not at their prices. Because they grow and sell their own weed (the same weed that other shops sell for over 1000 baht per gram), they are more competitive price wise than anywhere else youâ€™ll find similar quality of weed, there is no middle man getting a cut here at all.",
